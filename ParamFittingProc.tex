\begin{itemize}
    \item  Adjust load line pressure intercept.

    Pressure/Flow curves (upper left):
    adjust Psource_SIu to move the load line and sim trajectory (they should overlap)
    up and down.  Adjust Rsource_SIu to adjust its slope (higher values slope down more).

    \item Adjust stop-start thresholds.

    Pressure-Time curves (middle left):
    Adjust PBA_static up or down to match the pressure peaks in experiment (green dashed).
    Adjust PHalt_dyn  up or down to match the pressure valleys.

    \item Adjust threshold taper.

    Pressure-Time curves (middle left):
    Adjust Threshold Taper up or down to speed or slow down convergence of the thresholds.

    \item Adjust Friction or drag

    Length-Time curves (middle right):
    Adjust the viscus drag constant of tubing (K_drag) up or down to match the overall slope
    of the data trace.

    Adjust max tubing length (Lmax) to match stopping point of data.

    \tiem Experiment with other parameters or go back and repeat the procedure.
